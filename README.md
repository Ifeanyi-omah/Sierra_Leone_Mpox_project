The mpox virus (MPXV) has emerged with sustained human transmission across multiple countries in recent years. In January 2025, Sierra Leone reported its first mpox case in eight years. The incidence of mpox cases increased sharply from April 2025, with Sierra Leone rapidly becoming the epicentre of the continental Clade IIb A.2.2 outbreak with over 5000 cases as of September 2025. To investigate the timing and geographic origin of the epidemic lineage and track its transmission across Sierra Leone, we generated 338 new MPXV genomes and performed Bayesian phylogeographic reconstructions. We found that the epidemic was driven by a novel Clade IIb lineage (termed G.1), which descended from lineages circulating in the ongoing Nigerian epidemic. We found that G.1 emerged in late September 2024 and circulated cryptically for months prior to its detection while establishing persistent transmission in the Western Area Urban district. The Western Area Urban district acted as the persistent and predominant source of interdistrict viral dispersal across the epidemic, with epidemics in other districts driven by repeat introductions.  Our findings support that effective control of mpox remains achievable through targeted interventions that disrupt key transmission networks using rapid deployment of vaccination, supported by strengthened early warning systems, including genomic surveillance, as well as improved access to diagnostics.
